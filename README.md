# Project Title
## Audible Insights: Intelligent Book Recommendations

### Problem Statement
Design a book recommendation system that retrieves book details from given datasets, processes and cleans the data before applying NLP techniques and clustering methods, and builds multiple recommendation models. The final application will allow users to search for book recommendations using a user-friendly interface deployed with Streamlit and hosted on AWS.

### Approach
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Use two provided datasets containing book information, ratings, and user interactions.
   - Merge the datasets based on common attributes like book names and authors.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data by imputing or removing incomplete records.
   - Standardize formats for fields like genres and ratings.
   - Remove duplicate records.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze book genres, ratings distribution, and other trends.
   - Visualize key insights like the most popular genres, top-rated books, and trends in publication years.
4. **NLP and Clustering**:
   - Apply NLP techniques to extract features from book titles, descriptions, or reviews.
   - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means or DBSCAN) to group books based on similarities in features.
5. **Recommendation System Development**:
   - Build recommendation models using:
     - Content-Based Filtering (based on book features like genres, descriptions, etc.)
     - Clustering-Based Recommendations
     - Hybrid Approaches
   - Compare these models using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and RMSE.
6. **Application Development**:
   - Build a user interface using Streamlit to:
     - Input user preferences (e.g., favorite genres or books).
     - Display personalized book recommendations.
7. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to AWS, ensuring accessibility and scalability.

### Data Flow and Architecture
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Merge and clean the provided datasets.
   - Store the processed data locally or in an AWS S3 bucket.
2. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data using Python libraries like pandas.
   - Perform feature engineering for recommendation models.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Develop models using libraries like scikit-learn or Surprise.
   - Save trained models for deployment.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Use Streamlit to create a user-friendly front end.
   - Host the application on AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk.
